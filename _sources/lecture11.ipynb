    "Up until now we have considered how to approximate a generic function $f(x)$ in a function space $V_N = \\text{span}\\{\\psi_j\\}_{j=0}^N$. We have considered both variational formulations (Galerkin and least squares) and collocation (interpolation). But the underlying original problem has simply been to find some function $u \\approx u_N = \\sum_{j=0}^N\\hat{u}_j \\psi_j$ such that $u = f$.\n",
