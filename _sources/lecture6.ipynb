The solver should be implemented for a generic right hand side function , such that you can test the solver using the method of manufactured solutions (see the 1D Poisson solver). Implement first the solver for homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Note that this restricts the possible solutions to all solutions that are zero on the entire boundary.\n",
