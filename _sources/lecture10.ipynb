Similarly, the FEM approximation using second order polynomials should be fourth order. As stated in [lecture 9](https://matmek-4270.github.io/matmek4270-book/lecture9.html) the Chebyshev and Legendre approximations have spectral accuracy, which is faster than any finite order. This is easy to illustrate. In the figure below we plot the $L^2$ errors of the Legendre/Chebyshev approximations as well as the FEM. Note how the spectral methods accellerate towards machine precision, whereas the error for FEM disappears at a rate proportional to $N^{-2}$ and $N^{-4}$. "
