In order to incorporate the Dirichlet boundary condition we add a boundary term $B(x)$ and solve for $\\tilde{u}^{n+1}_N = u^{n+1}_N - B(x)$, where $\\tilde{u}^{n+1}_N(0, t) = \\tilde{u}^{n+1}_N(L, t)=0$. Note that we get exactly the same equation for $u^{n+1}_N$ as for $\\tilde{u}^{n+1}_N$ since all terms with $B(x)$ will be eliminated when inserting $u^{n+1}_N = \\tilde{u}^{n+1}_N+B(x)$ and $u^{n}_N = \\tilde{u}^{n}_N+B(x)$. But we solve the equation for $\\tilde{u}^{n+1}_N$, with the zero boundary conditions, and then to get $u^{n+1}_N$ we simply add $B(x)$.\n",
