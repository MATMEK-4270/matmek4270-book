The regular procedure now would be to clone the fork to your local computer and then work locally and push code to the global repository (the fork) intermittently (git commit and git push). However, if you're not used to this workflow, github now comes with a new and brilliant feature called [codespaces](github.com/features/codespaces), which allows you to both code and run interactively in the clouds and also inside a very nice visual studio code environment:-) To use it simply press the green `Code` button and then choose codespaces. Create a codespace and you should then soon find yourself in a working environment. From here you can modify code, test with pytest, commit and then push back to `Github.com`. Note that you only have up to 60 hours of free use per month. However, this is a very easy way to get started if you are inexperienced with the use of github and environments.\n",
