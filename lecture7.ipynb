And why would you want to waste your hard earned second-order accurate mesh function (or exact, as above) using only first order accurate interpolation? You shouldn't and there is no need to. Linear interpolation makes use of only 2 interpolation points. Higher order interpolation simply makes use of more points. The most straight-forward way to do this is through the use of [Lagrange interpolation polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial). \n",
